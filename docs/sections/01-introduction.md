## What is Digital Sovereignty?

[Definition and exploration of digital sovereignty in the context of infrastructure and software]

### Key Components

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Control over where and how data is stored and processed
2. **Infrastructure Independence**: Freedom to choose and change providers
3. **Technological Autonomy**: Ability to understand, modify, and control software
4. **Supply Chain Transparency**: Visibility into the entire software supply chain

## Beyond Community: The Enterprise Grade Imperative

### The Production Gap

[Explaining the difference between community projects and enterprise-ready distributions]

### What "Enterprise Grade" Really Means

- **Security and Lifecycle Management**: Long-term support, security patches, and vulnerability management
- **Stability and Testing**: Rigorous QA, compatibility testing, and certification programs
- **Support and Expertise**: 24/7 support, professional services, and deep product knowledge
- **Upstream Investment**: Contributing back to projects, not just consuming

### Red Hat's Upstream-First Model

[Explanation of how Red Hat invests in upstream communities while delivering enterprise value]

**Examples of Red Hat's upstream contributions:**
- [Specific projects and contribution levels]
- [Engineering headcount dedicated to upstream]
- [Leadership roles in foundations and projects]
